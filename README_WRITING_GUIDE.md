# **Standard for Project README Documentation**

This document defines the non-negotiable standard for all `README.md` files. The README is the canonical entry point for any project; it is a critical specification document, not an informal description. Its purpose is to provide a clear, accurate, and efficient path for any developer to understand, set up, use, and test the software.

Adherence to this standard is mandatory. A project with a non-compliant, incomplete, or outdated README is considered defective. The quality of this document is a direct reflection of the project's engineering discipline.

## **1. Structural Requirements**

Every README file must contain the following sections in this precise order. These sections are mandatory unless explicitly noted.

## **1.1. Project Title**

The official name of the project, formatted as a level-1 Markdown heading.

## **1.2. Project Summary**

A single, declarative sentence that defines the project's exact function. This summary must be concise and free of marketing language. It answers the question, "What does this project do?"

## **1.3. Detailed Description**

An expanded section that provides critical context, including:

- The specific problem the project is designed to solve.
- The core capabilities and features of the solution.
- Optionally, a high-level architecture diagram to illustrate the system's design.

## **1.4. Technology Stack**

A definitive list of the primary technologies used to build the project. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Programming Languages (with version)
- Frameworks and Libraries
- Databases or Storage Engines
- Runtimes (e.g., Node.js, JVM)

## **1.5. Getting Started**

This section must provide a complete, verifiable procedure for setting up a local development environment. It must be sufficiently detailed for a new developer to get the project running without external assistance.

## **Prerequisites**

An exhaustive list of all development dependencies that must be installed on the local machine before setup can begin. Each item must specify a version and include the exact command required for its installation.

## **Installation**

A numbered list of the precise, sequential shell commands required to configure the project for local execution. This procedure must be idempotent and repeatable.

## **1.6. Usage**

Clear, executable examples demonstrating the project's primary functionalities.

- For command-line tools, this must include examples of the commands and their expected output.
- For APIs, this must include sample `cURL` requests and the exact JSON responses.
- For libraries, this must include minimal, runnable code snippets.

## **1.7. Testing**

This section must provide the single, exact command required to execute the complete automated test suite. It must also describe the expected output of a successful run. The existence of a comprehensive test suite is a foundational requirement.

## **1.8. License**

Distributed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more information.

## **2. Content and Maintenance Mandates**

- **Precision and Clarity**: All language must be unambiguous, professional, and direct. The document should be optimized for the reader, reflecting the principle of **Ultimate Readability**.
- **Verifiable Truth**: Every command, code snippet, and instruction in the README is considered part of the project's specification and must be tested and verified for correctness. Documentation that is incorrect is a bug and must be fixed with the same urgency as a code defect.
- **Synchronized Maintenance**: The README is not a "write-once" document. It must be updated within the same pull request that introduces changes to code, configuration, or functionality. An outdated README represents a project failure. Unused or irrelevant sections must be removed immediately.
- **No Ambiguity**: The document must be self-contained. Do not rely on implicit knowledge or external, un-linked resources. All intentions must be explicit.
