# Foundational Coding Standards

This repository contains a set of strict, non-negotiable coding standards designed to produce simple, robust, verifiable, and maintainable code. These documents serve as the foundation for delegating development work to any agent, ensuring consistency and quality through automated enforcement.

## The Guiding Philosophy

All language-specific standards are implementations of a single, unified philosophy.
Before consulting a language-specific guide, it is mandatory to read and understand the core principles that govern all work:

- [**DESIGN_PRINCIPLES_GUIDE.md**](https://www.google.com/search?q=DESIGN_PRINCIPLES_GUIDE.md 'null'): The single source of truth for our development philosophy, including Test-Driven Correctness, Automated Quality Enforcement, and Verifiable Truth.

## Language-Specific Standards

Each of the following documents provides a detailed, practical implementation of the core principles for a specific language. They include mandatory toolchains, robust examples, and clear, non-negotiable rules.

- [**Go**](https://www.google.com/search?q=GO_CODING_STANDARD.md 'null'): A strict guide to modern Go, mandating `golangci-lint`, Test-Driven Development, and self-documenting code.

- [**Python**](https://www.google.com/search?q=PYTHON_CODING_STANDARD.md 'null'): A strict guide to modern Python, mandating a `ruff`/`black`/`mypy` toolchain, Test-Driven Correctness, and clear, self-documenting patterns.

- [**Bash**](https://www.google.com/search?q=BASH_CODING_STANDARD.md 'null'): A strict guide for writing safe, simple, and reliable shell scripts, mandating `shellcheck` and robust error handling.

These standards are not suggestions; they are requirements enforced by automated checks.
